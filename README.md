## About The Project
Upon initiating the project, the initial sequence involves encountering a splash screen, followed by a __loading page__, and ultimately arriving at the __entry page__.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Loading Page</td>
    <td>Entry Page</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Tour-Project/blob/Editing-screenshots/tour-project-ss/Screenshot-1.png" width="500"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Tour-Project/blob/Editing-screenshots/tour-project-ss/Screenshot-2.png" width="500"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Upon pressing the ```Space``` key, you will be directed to the __LogIn__ page, offering options to access the system, navigate to the __Sign Up__ window, or proceed to the __Forgot Password__ window.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Log In Page</td>
    <td>Sign Up Page</td>
    <td>Forgot Password Page</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Tour-Project/blob/Editing-screenshots/tour-project-ss/Screenshot-3.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Tour-Project/blob/Editing-screenshots/tour-project-ss/Screenshot-4.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Tour-Project/blob/Editing-screenshots/tour-project-ss/Screenshot-5.png" width="350"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Successfully logging into the system grants you access to a variety of buttons, as depicted in the image.

Under the __Create Packages__, you have the ability to add new tour packages, modify existing ones, remove unnecessary packages, or search for specific ones as needed.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>New Button Window</td>
    <td>Edit Button Window</td>
    <td>Delete Button Message</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Tour-Project/blob/Editing-screenshots/tour-project-ss/Screenshot-8.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Tour-Project/blob/Editing-screenshots/tour-project-ss/Screenshot-9.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Tour-Project/blob/Editing-screenshots/tour-project-ss/Screenshot-10.png" width="350"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Within the __Purchased Packages__ section, attention will now be directed towards the __Print__ button, a feature that was not previously showcased in the __Create Package__ section, while the remaining functionalities operate in a similar manner.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>General Tab</td>
    <td>Page Setup Tab</td>
    <td>Apperance Tab</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Tour-Project/blob/Editing-screenshots/tour-project-ss/Screenshot-11.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Tour-Project/blob/Editing-screenshots/tour-project-ss/Screenshot-12.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Tour-Project/blob/Editing-screenshots/tour-project-ss/Screenshot-13.png" width="350"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The __Packages Slideshow__ showcases images of destinations featured in the tour agent's itineraries, akin to patrons viewing a menu on a large TV screen in restaurants.

The __Calculator__ button is configured to prompt the system to launch the default calculator from the desktop.

In contrast to the __Calculator__ button, I designed the entire __Notepad__ button functionality.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>File Tab</td>
    <td>Edit Setup Tab</td>
    <td>Help Tab</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Tour-Project/blob/Editing-screenshots/tour-project-ss/Screenshot-15.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Tour-Project/blob/Editing-screenshots/tour-project-ss/Screenshot-16.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Tour-Project/blob/Editing-screenshots/tour-project-ss/Screenshot-17.png" width="350"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The __About__ button, both within the __Notepad__ and on the main page, displays concise messages.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Notepad About</td>
    <td>Main About</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Tour-Project/blob/Editing-screenshots/tour-project-ss/Screenshot-18.png" width="500"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Tour-Project/blob/Editing-screenshots/tour-project-ss/Screenshot-19.png" width="500"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
